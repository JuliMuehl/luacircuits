# Dependencies
[Luajit](https://luajit.org/) (The code can also be run with the [Lua5.2](https://www.lua.org/) interpreter but the performance won't be as good)

[LOVE2D](https://www.love2d.org/) (Required for the circuit editor)

# How to Run
If Love2D is installed on your system you can run the circuit editor (main.lua) with
```bash
$ love .
```
